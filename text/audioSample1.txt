this Ted talk features business romantic Tim lever act recorded live at Ted summit two thousand sixteen 
have the human workforce is expected to be replaced by software and robust in the next twenty years 
and many corporate leaders welcome that as a chance to increase profits 
machines a more efficient 
humans are complicated and difficult to manage 
well 
I want to organizations to remain human 
in fact I want them to become beautiful 
because these machines take a job to do the more efficiently 
soon the only work left for us humans will be the kind of work that must be done beautifully 
rather than efficient 
to maintain our humanity in the second machine age we may have no other choice 
then 
create beauty 
beauty is an elusive concept for the rider stand tall it was the promise of happiness 
for me it's a goal by Leon and messy 
so bear with me 
as I'm proposing for admittedly very subjective principles that you can use to build a beautiful organization 
first 
do the unnecessary 
a few months ago Hyundai who Chiodo CEO and founder of the your company to Bonnie made headlines when he decided to grants talk to all of its two thousand employees 
some called it a PR stunt 
others a genuine act of giving back but there's something else that was remarkable about 
it can completely out of the blue there had been no market or stakeholder pressure and employees were so surprised that the burst into tears when they heard the news 
actions like requires a beautiful because they catch us off guard 
the create something out of nothing 
because the completely unnecessary 
I once worked at a company that was the result of a merger of a large IT outsourcing firm 
and a small designed for we've emerging nine thousand software engineers with one thousand creative types 
and to unify these immensely different cultures we were going to launch a third new brands and the new brand color was going to be 
orange 
and as we were going for the budget for the rollout 
we decided last minute 
to cut the purchase of ten thousand orange balloons 
which we had meant to distribute to all staff worldwide 
they just seemed unnecessary and cute and the 
I didn't know back then 
that our decision marked the beginning of the end that these two organizations would never become one 
and sure enough the merger eventually failed now was it because there weren't any orange balloons 
no of course not 
but the kill the orange balloons mentality permeated everything else 
you might not always realize it but when you cut the unnecessary 
you cut everything 
leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary 
so do not kill your parents balloons 
the second principle 
create intimacy 
studies show that how we feel about a workplace very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers 
and what of relationships other than a string of micro interactions to hundreds of these every day in organizations 
that have the potential to distinguish a good life from a beautiful one 
the marriage researcher John Gottman says that the secret of a healthy relationship 
is not the great gesture on the lofty promise 
small moments of a catch 
in other words intimacy 
in our network organization sweet how the strength of weak ties 
but we underestimate the strength of strong ones we forget the words of the writer Richard Bach who once said intimacy 
not connectedness intimacy is the opposite of loneliness 
so how do we design for organizational intimacy 
the humanitarian organization care wanted to launch a campaign on gender equality in villages in northern India 
but realize quickly that it had to have this conversation first with its own staff 
so it invited all thirty six team members 
and our partners 
to one of the hydro temples known for their famous erotic sculptures 
there they openly discussed their personal relationships 
their own experiences of gender equality 
with the coworkers and the partners 
it was eye opening for the participants not only did allow them to relate to the communities they serve 
it also broke down invisible barriers 
and create a lasting bond amongst themselves not a single key member quit in the next four years 
so this is how you create intimacy 
no masks 
or lots of masks 
when Danone the food company wanted to translate its new company 
the festival 
product initially 
it gathers the management team and one hundred employees from across different departments 
a seniority levels and regions for a three day strategy retreat 
and ask everybody to wear costumes for the entire meeting weeks 
crazy hats for the boss huge glasses and so on 
and they left with concrete outcomes 
full of enthusiasm 
and when I asked the woman 
who had designed this experience wide work she simply said 
never underestimate the power of ridiculous wake 
because weeks erase hierarchy 
hire a cheap kilts intimacy both ways 
for the C. E. O. and the inter 
weeks allow us to use the disguise of defaults 
show something true about ourselves 
and that's not easy in our everyday work last because the relationship or the organizations 
it's often like that of a married couple 
that has grown apart 
suffered betrayals and disappointments 
and is now desperate to be beautiful for one another once again 
and for either of us the first step toward beauty involves a huge risk 
the risk to be ugly 
so many organizations these days are keen on designing beautiful workplaces 
that look like anything but work vacation resorts coffee shops playgrounds or college campuses 
based on the promises of positive psychology we speak of play and gain the fixation 
and once start up even says that when someone gets fired they have graduated 
that kind of beautiful language only goes skin deep 
but ugly cats clean to the bone 
as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it to be authentic is 
to be ugly 
it doesn't mean that 
you can have fun now you must give into the vault or cynical but it does mean that you speak the actual ugly truth 
like this many factor of that wanted to transform one of its struggling business units 
it identified named and pinned on March fourth all the issues there are hundreds of them that had become obstacles to better performance 
it put them on boards move tomorrow into one room which it called the ugly room 
oddly became visible for everyone to see it was celebrated 
and the other room served as a mix of narrow exhibition an operating room a biopsy on the living flash to cut out all the Barack prissy 
the obvious part of a body 
is a brain 
literally and neurologically 
a brain renders ugly what is unfamiliar 
modern art atonal music jast maybe VR goggles for that matter 
strange objects sounds 
and people 
but we've all been ugly once we were we're looking baby 
a new kid on the block a foreigner 
and we will be ugly again 
when we don't belong 
the center for political beauty and activist collective in Berlin recently states an extreme artistic intervention 
with the permission of relatives and execute the corpses of refugees were drowned at Europe's borders 
transported them all the way to Berlin and then reburied them at the heart of the German capital 
the idea was to allow them to reach the desired destination if only after their death 
such acts of beautification may not be pretty 
but they're a much needed because things tend to get ugly when there's only one meaning one truth only answers and no question 
beautiful organizations keep asking questions 
they remain incomplete 
which is the fourth and the last of the principles 
recently I was in Paris 
and a friend of mine took me to new lead to boo 
which stands for up all night to self organize protest movement that had formed in response 
the proposed label lost in France 
every night hundreds gathered at the plus the la few bleak every night they set up a small temporary village to deliberate their own vision of the French Republic 
and at the core of this ad hoc prissy 
was a General Assembly where anybody could speak using a specially designed sign language 
like occupy Wall Street and other protest movements 
no we did who was born in the face of crisis 
it was messy 
full of controversies in contradictions 
but whether you agreed with the movement's goals are not every gathering was a beautiful lesson and raw humanity 
and how fitting at Paris 
CD of ideals to CD of beauty 
was it states it reminds us that like great cities the most beautiful organization our ideas worth fighting for 
even and especially when the outcome is uncertain 
they all movements 
they're always in perfect never fully organized so they avoid ever becoming banal they have something but we don't know what it is they remain mysterious we can't take our eyes of 
find them 
beautiful 
so to do the unnecessary 
create intimacy 
to be ugly 
to remain incomplete 
these are not only the qualities of beautiful organizations 
these are inherently human characteristics 
and these are also the qualities of what we call 
home 
an SP disrupt 
and are disrupted the least we can do is to ensure that we still feel at home 
in our organizations 
and that we use organizations to create that feeling for others 
beauty can save the world when he embraced his principles and designed for them 
in the face of artificial intelligence and machine learning we need a new radical humanism we must acquire and promote a new aesthetic 
sentimental education 
because if we don't 
we might end up feeling like aliens 
and organizations and societies that are full of smart machines 
that have no appreciation whatsoever 
for the unnecessary 
the intimate 
the incomplete 
and deftly not for the ugly
